# p5js-CoordinateTransformation
Use any function to map onto different coordinate systems. It passes variables through the function and takes some range and step parameters to spit out the new coordinates, and adds the points to matrices that define coordinate lines along each new axis. The lines are drawn using p5's curve() function, which just makes the lines smoother between points.

## Future
* I plan to add more controlled animation, including (hopefully) smooth animations between two separate coordinate systems.
* I might also add user interactivity, potentially using methods similar to this ControllableCurve demonstration: https://codepen.io/bradylambert/pen/mBeWPW
